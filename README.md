# Mall Customer Segmentation
## 1. About the Dataset
The dataset Mall_Customers.csv contains information about customers from a mall, with the following columns:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Gender: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
Age: Age of the customer.
Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
Spending Score (1-100): Spending score assigned to the customer by the mall.
The dataset has 200 records and 5 attributes, providing a snapshot of customer demographics and spending behavior.

## 2. Objective
The primary goal of this project is to perform customer segmentation based on their spending behavior and income. By identifying distinct customer segments, the analysis aims to:

Uncover insights into different customer profiles.
Assist in targeted marketing and personalized promotions.
Optimize resource allocation and enhance customer satisfaction.
## 3. Approach
Data Exploration:

Loaded and examined the dataset to understand its structure.
Checked for missing values and descriptive statistics.
Data Visualization:

Analyzed distributions of Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.
Created visualizations such as histograms, pie charts, and box plots to explore relationships and patterns.
Clustering Analysis:

Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups based on Annual Income and Spending Score.
Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Visualized the clusters to interpret different customer segments.
## 4. Results & Key Features
Customer Segments: Identified five distinct clusters of customers:

General: Average spending and income.
Miser: Low spending and income.
Target: High spending but moderate income.
Careful: Low spending but high income.
Spendthrift: High spending and high income.
Visualization Insights:

Distribution Plots: Showed typical ranges and frequencies for age and income.
Cluster Analysis: Highlighted patterns and groups, aiding in understanding customer behavior and preferences.
These insights help in targeting specific customer segments more effectively, enhancing marketing strategies and operational efficiency.
